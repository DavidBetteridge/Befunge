## Build a Befunge Parser

* Use your preferred language to build a Befunge parser.
  * Given a program in a 2D Grid, your parser should navigate through the program & output the result.
  * Start by implementing a `simple` calculator which just reads across a single line & outputs a result.
  * For example, this calculation should give you a result of 42:
  
  ```32*81-*.@``` 

---
## Create Befunge Programs
* Extend your parser to handle loops and conditional statements.
  * Test your parser by creating a Befunge program which counts down from 10 until 1 before printing "Liftoff"
  * Create a Befunge program which calculates `x` to the power of `y` i.e. x=2, y=4 should give a result of 16.  For simplicity x & y are both between 1 & 9.
  * Create a Befunge program which calculates the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.
  * Create a Befunge program which calculates `x` Factorial.
  
######  NB - If possible try & solve the above problems **without** using the `p` & `g` operators to update the Program Grid.
